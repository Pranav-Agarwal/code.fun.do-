Project Idea for team 'Beach Party'

                                                    Shelter management application

Our idea is to create an application that will aid in preparing for natural disasters. The application will serve as a smart tool to guide the setting up of shelters in case of natural disasters. As input, it will require a map of the city along with an approximate distribution of the population. The application will analyze this distribution and will generate location points where shelters should be set up to maximize the efficiency of aid disbursal and maximize the number of people receiving help from the system of shelters. After the city administration sets up the shelters in accordance with their budget constraints, they can mark the location of the shelter on the application.
The application will allow users to create accounts and login. Using their current location, it will dynamically guide them to the closest shelter using the locations of all the built shelters provided to it. In case of a natural calamity, the location of all the users will be collected in a central database and a heat-map will be created. This dynamic heat-map will be accessible to the city administration and first-responders to help them shape and guide their rescue efforts optimally.
